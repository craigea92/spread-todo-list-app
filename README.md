# Spread Todo List App

## Project Description

Previously, I had built a To Do List App with NodeJS and I decided to create a similar app with React. The app enables the user to add items to a list and remove them with a simple click.

While working on this project, I encountered only a few challenges. However, I did learn some new techniques, such as how to clear the input field after adding an item, which improved the user experience. I also utilized passing an id using the index as a workaround to create the deleteItem function, although it is not a technique I would normally use in a professional setting.

In terms of future development, I do not intend to add to this repository. I have already built a few similar apps, and I am eager to try my hand at different types of projects to further develop my skills.
