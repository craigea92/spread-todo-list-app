# Spread Todo List App

## Project Description

Previously, I had built a To Do List App with NodeJS and I decided to create a similar app with React. The app enables the user to add items to a list and remove them with a simple click.

While working on this project, I encountered only a few challenges. However, I did learn some new techniques, such as how to clear the input field after adding an item, which improved the user experience. I also utilized passing an id using the index as a workaround to create the deleteItem function, although it is not a technique I would normally use in a professional setting.

In terms of future development, I do not intend to add to this repository. I have already built a few similar apps, and I am eager to try my hand at different types of projects to further develop my skills.

## What is the Spread Operator?
Introduced in ES6, the spread operator allows you to expand or spread arrays and objects into multiple elements. This can be useful when copying arrays or objects or when working with a number of arguments or properties.

## What are Memoized Functions?
Mezoization is an optimization technique, similar to caching. It works by storing the previous results of a function call and using those results the next time the function runs. It is especailly useful in computation-heavy apps that repeat function call on the same parameters.
